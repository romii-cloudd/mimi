<p align style="font-size:20px"> My name is Raina Jessica Ramirez, from grade 9 - Fidelity. I'm 15 years old and my birthday is on Sept. 3, 2009. 
The thing that I like the most is when I'm laying in bed after a long day and just listening to music while reading a comic book. My favorite color is pink, more specifically
light pink. Yes, I do enjoy socializing, especially when it comes to my friends. When I'm with them, I feel so energized as if I don't have any problems in the world. However, my introvert side is always
dominant compared to my extroverted side. Because, no matter how many times I say that I like going out and socializing, there's still this part of me that don't want to 
and would rather just stay in my house. This can sometimes cause me problems, especially with decision makings.<br><br>

I like listening to OPM, it's my most favorite genre of all times. 
<h3>Here's my favorite songs:</h3>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Miss Miss - Rob Daniel</li>
<li>Misteryoso - Cup of Joe</li>
<li>Museo - Eliza Maturan</li>
<li>RomCom - Rob Daniel</li>
<li>Ikaw at Ako - TJ Monterde</li>
<li>Musika - Dionela</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p align style="font-size:20px">The song that's playing right now is called Sinta by Rob Daniel. I think he's my favorite singer at the moment because of his lovely voice.
I'm sorry if I've only been talking about my favorite songs. Before I end this, I'll give one last fact about me. I like being there for people, my friends, and family.
I don't like seeing people sad or not being able to do anything because a huge part of me feels bad for them. So, I do my best to help, if not, at least listen to their 
problems and just be there for them.</p>
