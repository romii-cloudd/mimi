<p style="text-align:right; font-size:25px;"><i>My church has campus missionaries that go to every campus to share the Word of God while establishing a friendly and spiritual bond with the students. I've been attending
this life group since the start of grade 8. I'm proud and excited at the same time that I've been able to invite a lot of my friends and classmates to join our life group. It's 
truly a wonderful answered prayer from God. Each picture holds a memory that I would like to keep and hold dear in my heart.</i></p>

<p style="text-align:left; font-size:25px;"><i>I thought the 1st quarter of grade 9 would be the same like always, everyone's still shy with each other and some stick close to their own friend
groups. However, that only happened for like the first three days of 1st quarter. I was really surprised to see that almost everyone of us are comfortable
with being with each other and being friends. It also made me excited for what the future have for us. I know, it's still the 1st quarter, but I feel like
it's already been a long time that I've been with and know them.</i></p>

<p style="text-align:right; font-size:25px;"><i>I made a lot of new friends and whenever I'm with or simple just see them, my day immediately brightens up. While, my old friends Angel, Rodilyn, 
Irca, Raven and Nathan are still there to make my day even better. However, I made two new friends that has a special place in my heart like Angel and the others. They're Cairis and Andres. 
I don't know what I did or what happened but I just know that they've been so loving and supportive in my life, and that's what I appreciate the most. New or old, these people are the ones that 
support, help and love me no matter what happens.</i></p>
